  "readme": "gulp-nodemon\n===========\n\nit's gulp + nodemon + convenience\n\n## Install \n\n```bash\n$ npm install --save-dev gulp-nodemon\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nGulp-nodemon looks almost exactly like regular nodemon, but it's made for use with gulp tasks.\n\n### **nodemon([options])**\n\nYou can pass an object to gulp-nodemon with options [like you would in nodemon config](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#config-files).\n\nExample below will start `server.js` in `development` mode and watch for changes, as well as watch all `.html` and `.js` files in the directory.\n```javascript\ngulp.task('start', function () {\n  nodemon({\n    script: 'server.js'\n  , ext: 'js html'\n  , env: { 'NODE_ENV': 'development' }\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## Synchronous Build Tasks\n\n*NOTE: This feature requires Node v0.12 because of `child_process.spawnSync`.*\n\nNodemon is powerful but lacks the ability to compile/cleanup code prior to restarting the application... until now! Most build systems can never be complete without compilation, and now it works harmoniously with your nodemon loop.\n\n### **{ tasks: [Array || Function(changedFiles)] }**\n\nIf you want to lint your code when you make changes that's easy to do with a simple event. But what if you need to wait while your project re-builds before you start it up again? This isn't possible with vanilla nodemon, and can be tedious to implement yourself, but it's easy with gulp-nodemon:\n```javascript\nnodemon({\n  script: 'index.js'\n, tasks: ['browserify']\n})\n```\n\nWhat if you want to decouple your build processes by language? Or even by file? Easy, just set the `tasks` option to a function. Gulp-nodemon will pass you the list of changed files and it'll let you return a list of tasks you want run.\n```javascript\nnodemon({\n  script: './index.js'\n, ext: 'js css'\n, tasks: function (changedFiles) {\n    var tasks = []\n    changedFiles.forEach(function (file) {\n      if (path.extname(file) === '.js' && !~tasks.indexOf('lint')) tasks.push('lint')\n      if (path.extname(file) === '.css' && !~tasks.indexOf('cssmin')) tasks.push('cssmin')\n    })\n    return tasks\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Events\n\ngulp-nodemon returns a stream just like any other NodeJS stream, **except for the `on` method**, which conveniently accepts gulp task names in addition to the typical function.\n\n### **.on([event], [Array || Function])**\n\n1. `[event]` is an event name as a string. See [nodemon events](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/events.md).\n2. `[tasks]` An array of gulp task names or a function to execute.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following example will run your code with nodemon, lint it when you make changes, and log a message when nodemon runs it again.\n\n```javascript\n// Gulpfile.js\nvar gulp = require('gulp')\n  , nodemon = require('gulp-nodemon')\n  , jshint = require('gulp-jshint')\n\ngulp.task('lint', function () {\n  gulp.src('./**/*.js')\n    .pipe(jshint())\n})\n\ngulp.task('develop', function () {\n  nodemon({ script: 'server.js'\n          , ext: 'html js'\n          , ignore: ['ignored.js']\n          , tasks: ['lint'] })\n    .on('restart', function () {\n      console.log('restarted!')\n    })\n})\n```\n",
